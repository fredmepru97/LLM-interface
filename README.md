# LLM Interfaces for Databases

Welcome to the LLM Interfaces for Databases project! This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the application using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, please ensure you have the following:

1. **Database File**: Place the `isrecon_all.duckdb` file in the root directory of the repository.
2. **Docker**: The Docker build process may take some time, as it involves transferring a 13 GB dictionary context to the Docker container.
3. **API Keys**: The application uses locally stored API Keys for LLama and Open AI. These have to be generated by the user of the application. If you would like to avoid that, please contact the team and we are happy to provide them.

## Running the Application

Follow these steps to start the application:

1. **Start Docker Daemon**
   - Make sure your Docker Daemon is running on your machine.

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the repository.
   - Run the following command to build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t app .
     ```
   - This command will create a Docker image tagged as `app`. The build process may take some time due to the large context size.

3. **Run the Docker Container**
   - After the image is built, run the following command to start the application:
     ```bash
     docker run app
     ```
   - This command will create and start a Docker container from the `app` image.

## Additional Information

- **File Size Consideration**: Due to the size of the `isrecon_all.duckdb` file, ensure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection if transferring the file.
- **Docker Tips**: If you encounter issues with Docker, refer to the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for troubleshooting and support.

For any questions or issues, please feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
