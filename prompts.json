However, in the absence of explicit guidelines for how to use QCA for theory development, the popularity and proliferation of QCA possibly amplifies the risk of using QCA in an a theoretical manner, hindering theoretical advancement. In this paper, we offer a conceptual framework and prescriptive guidelines for applying QCA to develop causal recipes that account for complex digital phenomena marked by theoretical and configurational multiplicity. Causal recipes are formal statements explaining how causally relevant elements combine into configurations associated with outcomes of interest. We describe these causal recipes in terms of which causes matter (i.e., factorial logic) and how these causes combine into configurations (i.e., combinatorial logic) to produce target outcomes, and propose an ecology of configurations that elucidates the explanatory power of multiple configurations as well as their explanatory overlap. Further, we offer two illustrative empirical examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework and step-by-step guidelines for applying QCA to deductive theory testing as well as inductive theory development on phenomena marked by multiplicity.",

As stated in the majority of existing literature on information systems, it is because project participants are self-interested parties with goal incongruence and information asymmetry between them. Accordingly, the relationship between controller and controlee has been generally described as similar to the one that exists between principal and agent under agency theory. Consequently, control activities have predominantly been seen as efforts to minimize related agency problems. The only exception so far is the study of Remus and his colleagues (2015), who found that control may also address coordination requirements. However, it remained unclear whether further control intentions exist. This paper introduces alternative theoretical viewpoints in addition to the agency and coordination aspects of control that may explain further control purposes in IS projects. The research thus contributes to literature by providing a broader view on control intentions in IS projects. Findings can benefit IS professionals by enabling them to consciously think about the purpose of control and hence to choose control mechanisms more effectively.",

Digital citizen engagement plays a significant role in supporting social accountability monitoring, by providing a platform for the youth to report on issues of access, hence collecting data for evidencebased engagement. The MobiSAfAIDS application is a digital citizen engagement initiative embedded within a holistic programme called 'Transforming Lives', which is aimed at transforming the policy environment towards upholding the sexual and reproductive health and rights of adolescents and young people. What emerges from citizen engagement, are the dynamics around government-citizen relationships and the influence of 'power' to determine the outcome of engagement, as well as agreed spaces, forms, and levels of participation. The paper uses Agency Theory and the Power cube to explore the role of MobiSAfAIDS as an enabling tool for citizen engagement and social accountability monitoring of access to adolescent SRH services. Pragmatist interpretivism is applied to a longitudinal case study of MobiSAfAIDS, through primary observations and experiences of the researchers in implementing the project in the empirical setting. Abductive reasoning was applied through iterative dialog between theory and empirical data to build the framework. What is paramount in the developed framework is its cyclic nature, where government and youth citizens have to experience a number of cycles of learning and empowerment to eventually arrive at a Principal-Steward relationship for effective engagement and service delivery.

Using the routine but highly symbolic executive board discharge proposal voted on at the annual shareholder meetings of German firms, we argue that the board of directors understands these votes as a \u201cvote of confidence in management\u201d that challenges the CEO\u2019s mandate to lead the firm. Arguing that board chairs are uniquely positioned to take up the stance of a steward of the firm and its leadership, we examine how independent and family board chairs moderate the board\u2019s response to expressive voting dissent. Using a sample of German public firms over the period 2008\u20132015, we find that expressive voting dissent increases the chance of CEO dismissal increasingly with the level of dissent expressed. Contrary to prevailing agency theoretical expectations, we do not find that independent chairs are more responsive to expressive voting dissent, nor that this relationship is strengthened by the degree of minority institutional investor ownership of the firm. Consistent with the symbolic perspective on shareholder voting that we seek to develop, however, we find that family chairs are more likely to lead the board to dismiss the CEO due to the intrinsic disvalue they incur from symbolic leadership legitimacy challenges in their firms, and that the positive effect of having a family chair on the dissent induced chance of CEO dismissal is strengthened by the level of family ownership in the firm.

We develop a framework where activist shareholders resolve this problem by forming attributions about executives\u2019 intentions based on their displays of agentic values, which reflect independence and control. For activist shareholders, a strong display of independence can evoke concerns that an executive will act without the regulation of shareholder input, and a strong display of control can create concerns an executive will engineer governance provisions to their own benefit. As such, we hypothesize that above-average agentic value displays by CEOs increase the likelihood firms are targeted by shareholder activists. Extending our theory, we argue the positive effect that agentic value displays have on attracting shareholder activism is stronger when CEOs permit higher spending on corporate and stakeholder investment, both of which can exacerbate shareholder harm when executed poorly. We also posit that activism campaigns driven by CEOs\u2019 agentic value displays will largely come from activist shareholders seeking to exert their own control over agentic-speaking CEOs. Using data on shareholder activism campaigns at US-based companies from 2003\u20132018, we find support for our hypotheses.

To address this shortcoming, we conducted a factorial survey with 258 IS developers nested in 19 organizations.

Moreover, legitimacy operating on fairness and autonomy is an important lever for increasing compliance intentions.",

While flexibility allows projects to adapt to changing requirements, control helps reaching the desired time, cost and quality objectives. Agile approaches place higher emphasis on flexibility that challenges control conceptualizations typical in traditional ISD. Scarce research on controlling agile ISD provided conflicting control configuration recommendations probably due to different contexts and agile development rarely following instructions in a systematic manner. By drawing on a qualitative case study, we describe four distinct roles managers in agile ISD take contingent on contextual factors, and explore resulting control configurations in terms of control modes and enactment styles. Our findings in particular imply that costs of control fluctuate depending on the chosen role and that agency as a theoretical lens may be too narrow to understand the full spectrum of control activities in agile ISD projects.

Building on the contingency view of corporate governance, we argue that the presence of significant new entry threats (NET), a unique feature that differentiates the IT industry from many other industries, is a critical contextual variable that moderates this relationship. Leveraging a novel NET measure based on text mining, we show that facing high NET, firms with boards that have a higher proportion of independent directors, who contribute to explorative organizational learning, carry out more effective monitoring, and offer independent opinions in strategic decision making, outperform firms with fewer independent board members. To address the endogeneity of board independence, we use the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related changes to the NYSE/NASDAQ listing rules as exogenous shocks; we show that our results are robust to the correction for endogeneity issues. Further, we show that our findings are generalizable to other high tech industries that face significant threats of new entry emerging from fast-moving industry dynamics. However, these results do not extend to slow-moving industries that have a stable market structure and thereby face lower and more homogenous levels of NET. We discuss the implications for future research, and provide managerial guidelines for practice as well.",

Recent studies in neighboring disciplines, however, suggest that the agency view of control is too narrow to fully understand control activities. Informed by these studies as well as drawing on stewardship and coordination theory, we introduce the concept of control purpose to the IS literature. We define this concept as the intentions underlying the controller\u2019s control activities, and distinguish between appropriation- and coordination-oriented controls. To evaluate the control purpose concept, we conduct a secondary analysis of 21 IS project control case studies. Results show that, despite their stated agency focus, most studies report on controls addressing both appropriation concerns and coordination requirements. On this basis, we discuss two potential research areas, knowledge management and control dynamics, where the control purpose concept can offer novel insights.",
                    "13": "In this theoretical essay we apply three theories of governance in proposing a conceptual model of the relationship between information technology (IT) and supply chain governance (SCG) and its conceptions (contractual, transactional, and relational). We argue, theoretically, that with contractual governance, IT is used to control activities and processes across the supply chain and to enforce coordination and contract compliance. IT, in transactional governance, is used to reduce costs and complexity of transactions. This is achieved through the reduction of losses and errors, the minimization of opportunism, and the decrease in total expenditures of the systems. With relational governance, IT can be used to support a closer and more trustful relationship among organizations through the collaboration and integration of supply chain activities. We provide testable propositions that emerge from this analysis and discussion. We also argue that e-procurement, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and electronic data interchange (EDI) could be used with the three conceptions of SCG. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",

In recent years, boards of directors have also increased their involvement in IT matters, and various theoretical lenses suggest that this oversight too has the potential to influence organizational performance. Hence, this study synthesizes the resource-based and contingency views of MIS with corporate governance theories, and examines key antecedents and consequences of board-level IT governance (ITG) using a multi-method approach. Structural Equation Modelling analysis applied to organization-level data collected from 171 board members suggested that the level of ITG exercised by boards was contingent upon the organization's \u2018IT use mode\u2019, along the two dimensions of need for (a) fast and reliable IT, and (b) new innovative IT. But, the findings further suggested that the contingency approach may be suboptimal because it can cause new ways of leveraging IT to be ignored. High levels of board-level ITG, regardless of existing IT needs, increased organizational performance. This phenomenon was illuminated with applicability checks. Moreover, content analysis and structured interviews with board members further enriched these insights.",

The stewardship perspective argues that family business owners and managers will act as farsighted stewards of their companies, investing generously in the business to enhance value for all stakeholders. By contrast, the agency and behavioral agency perspectives maintain that major family owners, in catering to family self-interest, will underinvest in the firm, avoid risk, and extract resources. This paper argues that both these views have application but under different circumstances, determined in part by the degree to which the firm and its executive actors are embedded within the family and thus identify with its interests. Stewardship behavior will be less common, and agency behavior will be more common the greater the number of family directors, officers, generations, and votes, and the more executives are susceptible to family influence. These findings are supported among Fortune 1000 firms, as well as among the subsample of those firms that are family businesses.",

Drawing inspiration from stewardship theory, we posited that when messengers carrying risk warnings about a project are seen as collaborative partners, decision makers are more likely to heed the message. Conversely, we theorized that when messengers are seen as opponents, decision makers are more likely to exhibit the deaf effect. We further posited that certain psychological factors (i.e., framing and perceived control) would moderate the effect of the messenger-recipient relationship on the deaf effect. To test these ideas, we conducted two experiments. When messengers were seen as collaborative partners, recipients assigned more relevance to the risk warning and perceived a higher risk, making them less willing to continue the project. Framing the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project in terms of losses (rather than gains) weakened this effect. However, when recipients perceived a high degree of control over the project the effect was strengthened. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.",

Since the popularization of agile software development in the 2000s, the virtuous effects of transparent collaboration have been emphasized. However, some studies have alluded to concerns with full information disclosure and mentioned that teams may benefit by withholding some information. We used case studies to explore such sit\u00ad uations. We adopted a privacy theoretical lens because it is antithetical to the information disclosure lens and offers frames to comprehend how professional information can be retained by individuals, shared to restricted circles or entirely divulged. We found situations when the disclosure paradigm is challenged in agile processes. There is ambiguity in the disclosure message because individual and collective information retention do play a role in agile development. Our findings help refine information systems development philosophies and practices. We also extend our understanding of the communication privacy management theory to a context where full disclosure is preferred to privacy, and where control over privacy depends on allowances granted by a third party, which can generalize to other settings (e.g., social media platforms).",

A timely resignation is proactively pushed by the company, and a delayed resignation is driven by investigations initiated by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Our results show significant negative abnormal returns following the announcement of CEO resignations. In addition, compared with timely resignations, delayed resignations experience a larger and longer lasting negative stock market reaction. This suggests that CEO resignations due to financial wrongdoings are not perceived as good news by investors, and the delayed resignations could make investors lose more confidence, possibly because of worries about the ineffective corporate governance and supervision mechanism. We have found a significant negative relationship between CEO-chairman duality and the timeliness of CEO resignations. Our results have important implications for investors and policy makers.",

Most corporate governance research focuses on a universal link between corporate governance practices (e.g., board structure, shareholder activism) and performance outcomes, but neglects how interdependencies between the organization and diverse environments lead to variations in the effectiveness of different governance practices. In contrast to such closed systems approaches, we propose a framework based on open systems approaches to organizations, which examines these organizational interdependencies in terms of the costs, contingencies, and complementarities of different corporate governance practices. These three sets of organizational factors are useful in analyzing the effectiveness of corporate governance in diverse organizational environments. We also explore the impact of costs, contingencies, and complementarities on the effectiveness of different governance aspects through the use of stylized cases and discuss the implications for different approaches to policy such as soft law or hard law.",

Contrary to what agency theory suggests, in the InfoSec context, information asymmetry can be exactly what is needed to enhance the principal's welfare. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.",

Innovation is one such benefit that is expected nowadays in outsourcing engagements. The rising importance of innovation has been noticed and acknowledged not only in the Information Systems (IS) literature, but also in other management streams such as innovation and strategy. However, to date, these individual strands of research remain largely isolated from each other. Our theoretical review addresses this gap by consolidating and analyzing research on strategic innovation in the ITO and BPO context. The article set includes 95 papers published between 1998 and 2020 in outlets from the IS and related management fields. We craft a four-phase framework that integrates prior insights about (1) the antecedents of the decision to pursue strategic innovation in outsourcing settings; (2) arrange\u00ad ment options that facilitate strategic innovation in outsourcing relationships; (3) the generation of strategic innovations; and (4) realized strategic innovation outcomes, as assessed in the literature. We find that the research landscape to date is skewed, with many studies focusing on the first two phases. The last two phases remain relatively uncharted. We also discuss how innovation-oriented outsourcing insights compare with established research on cost-oriented outsourcing engage\u00ad ments. Finally, we offer directions for future research.",

Leaders at the top of the two inconsistent hierarchies can feel distressed and motivated to engage in contestation and challenge each other\u2019s authority, thus providing checks and balances and preventing groupthink. This monitoring effect is likely to be stronger when either of the two heads has dominant and unequivocal superiority in their respective hierarchy, making them particularly distressed by the hierarchical inconsistency and prone to contest.

Our study contributes to the corporate securities fraud literature by understanding how formal organizational structures and informal social relationships interact and jointly influence governance effectiveness in emerging markets.

We make a general case about the importance of governance in adaptation, and we identify three mechanisms through which governance form may affect organizations' ability to manage the competency and failure traps that often frustrate the process. We look for evidence of these mechanisms through a study of the U.S. Savings and Loan (S&L) industry in the 1980s. This is an apt context because S&Ls were confronted by severe environmental changes that suggested a need for change of a relatively radical sort during this decade and because the industry contains a mix of governance forms (stock form firms and mutual associations). We examine whether mutuals and stocks differed in their propensity to move away from their traditional business and mission of residential mortgage lending in response to the challenges of the 1980s. We also consider whether stocks and mutuals differed in their performance outcomes during this decade. Results indicate that mutuals were slightly less prone toward change but were in no sense inertial. They also show that mutuals performed better overall and appeared to change more successfully than did stock firms. The overall pattern of results suggests that mutual governance was a resource that allowed S&Ls to better balance exploration and exploitation in the face of a changing and ambiguous environment. We consider the broader implications of these findings for research on organizational adaptation, governance form, and governance more generally.",

Yet, only a minority of boards around the globe are taking up accountability for governing IT, pointing towards a knowing-doing gap. Efforts have been made to close this gap by creating implementation guidelines for this type of engagement. One of the most frequently mentioned guidelines is the implementation of an IT oversight or similar committee at board level. However, research shows that few boards have established such a committee, which might be caused by the lack of detailed guidance on the workings and role of such committees. This paper discusses the case of the University of Antwerp that has established two IT oversight committees at board level.

Formulating IT governance mechanisms is important for governments to perform their responsibilities and maximize public value. As service arrangers, governments\u2019 actions are affected by complex external environments for legitimacy, which has been largely ignored in the existing studies. By incorporating the strategic and institutional perspectives of legitimacy into Savas\u2019s service delivery structure, this study developed a triadic framework that accounts for different contextual determinants related to the external market environment and the institutional environment to investigate the formulation of IT governance mechanisms. A survey involving 329 town-level governments in Beijing, China, was done to validate our research model. The results illustrate that the demand-supply market forces have direct impacts on IT governance mechanism formulation in local governments. Institutional pressures exert a mediating effect by transiting the supply market force into governments\u2019 actions. Our triadic framework reveals a dynamic service delivery structure, contributing to Savas\u2019s service delivery structure and IT governance research.",
                    "30": " This study seeks to enhance understanding regarding the public sector stewardship of integrated services delivery initiatives in joined-up digital government, with a particular focus on understanding the nature of the steward's role in practice. This specifically includes the skills required of those performing stewardship, and the key challenges stewards faced. Eight interviews supplemented by the use of reflective journals were completed with stewards of the New Zealand public sector to understand their practice and perception of the steward concept. Three tiers of stewardship practice were identified: (1) Internal Stewardship, (2) Inter-Agency Stewardship, and (3) Stewardship as a Governance Model. Each tier exhibited unique challenges. Participants overcame these challenges through performing two complementary sub-roles: Navigator and Storyteller. Understanding the operational challenges of the stewardship tiers and how the stewardship roles were enacted has implications for both practitioners and researchers. ",

However, a broad stream of research points to the presence of pragmatic agile practitioners, who follow agile prescriptions less rigorously and tend to put just as much emphasis on project controls than on trust. ISD project control literature so far explained control activities mostly through agency theory and, to a lower extent, stewardship theory. These theories do not explain well this \"middle ground\" between trust and controls as they have radical views on actors: agency assumes self-interested utility maximizers; stewardship presumes self-sacrificing stewards. In this study, we introduce signaling theory for explaining control in Agile ISD that allows for more balanced views on developers, and propose an explanatory case study to review the use of three alternative theoretical models in this context.

                    "32": "Managing information systems (IS) projects requires what we refer to as \u2018control ambidexterity\u2019, which is the use of different types of control to meet conflicting demands. This leads to the use of contrasting styles of IS project management and creates tensions in managerial practice, neither of which are well understood. We address this theoretical gap in our understanding based on an exploratory case study of an IS implementation project in the financial services industry. Adopting the lens of management styles as a meta-theoretical perspective, we sought to address two research questions: (1) Which management style(s) do IS project managers draw upon in practice and why? (2) What kinds of tensions result for IS project managers and team members from drawing upon contrasting management styles in combination \u2013 and how do IS project managers and team members deal with these tensions? Two contrasting styles of management emerged from our data \u2013 bureaucratic and collaborative \u2013 that are drawn upon by IS project managers to achieve control ambidexterity. Furthermore, drawing upon these two different styles in combination within the confines of a single project creates tensions. We explore these tensions and present an illustrative example of how IS project managers can deal with these tensions successfully in practice. Specifically, we find that they can be dealt with effectively by a tandem of two project managers who share responsibility for managing the IS project. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of control ambidexterity in IS projects.",
                    "33": "Digital transformation is becoming ubiquitous as organizations increasingly rely on IT to create business value. As a result, IT strategy is increasingly intertwined with organizational strategy, with risks as IT becomes progressively more important, requiring both management and governance. Given boards of directors are ultimately accountable for strategic decision-making and control, these changes charge boards with accountability for governing digital assets. Whilst board-level IT governance should enable better organizational performance, research suggests that the value created by the board in governing IT depends on the roles they play. In exploring these roles, we use the more mature research domain of corporate governance to develop improved understanding of the type of board roles and the importance assigned by a board to governing IT.",
                    "34": "In this research commentary, we argue that the current digital era compels a reconsideration and problematization of research on information systems (IS) project control. IS projects are key to the pursuit of digital innovation and transformation activities, and the control of IS projects is central to creating and capturing value from these activities. However, IS project control research has not kept pace with current developments in the digital era. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01nd that existing research has been dominated by an underlying agency theory perspective, which is not attuned to salient aspects of current control settings, such as digital innovation initiatives, and thus restricts our understanding of IS project control. To address this shortcoming, we problematize core assumptions underlying existing IS project control research and draw on stewardship theory to present an alternative set of assumptions complementing the prevalent agency theory perspective; introduce the concept of control purpose (why); offer empirical support for its conceptual distinction between value-appropriation and value-creation control purposes; and develop a research agenda that helps move IS project control research into the digital era."
